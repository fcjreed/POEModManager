# POE Mod Manager

## Development server

You should be able to just run `mvn install` and it should pull in node, npm, and any npm modules. 

You can run `ng build --watch` to do constant building that will automatically be picked up by spring.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
